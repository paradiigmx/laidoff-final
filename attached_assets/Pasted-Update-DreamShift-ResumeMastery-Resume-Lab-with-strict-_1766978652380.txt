Update DreamShift/ResumeMastery “Resume Lab” with strict layout constraints so the resume ALWAYS fits cleanly and never overflows or compresses weirdly.

NON-NEGOTIABLE:
- Keep the hero/header UI unchanged.
- Keep only 3 templates: Modern, Executive, Minimal.
- Remove any “page count selector” UI. Pages should be automatic.
- Resume preview must be locked to true Letter size: 8.5in x 11in, margin 0.5in.
- Default output target is 1 page. If content still cannot fit after compression rules, automatically add page 2.

IMPLEMENT THESE HARD LIMITS:
A) Skills display cap:
- Keep all skills in data, but in preview show only MAX_SKILLS_SHOWN = 12.
- If there are more than 12, render a final badge: “+X more” instead of rendering the rest.

B) Experience bullet rules:
- Determine total role count (experience.length).
- If roles <= 3: maxBulletsPerRole = 4
- If roles == 4: maxBulletsPerRole = 3
- If roles >= 5: maxBulletsPerRole = 2
- Enforce max bullet word length (default 16 words). Trim extra words with an ellipsis.
- Never allow paragraph bullets.

C) Summary rules:
- Summary max 80 words, min 45 words target.
- If overflow, summary is trimmed down to 60 then 45 words.

D) “Fit Mode” (auto compression loop):
Create a function fitResumeToPage() that measures overflow in the preview container.
If overflow is detected, apply compression steps IN ORDER until it fits:
1) Reduce MAX_SKILLS_SHOWN from 12 → 10 → 8
2) Reduce maxBulletsPerRole by 1 (but never below 1)
3) Reduce bullet max words from 16 → 14 → 12
4) Reduce summary max words from 80 → 60 → 45
5) Reduce line-height from 1.35 → 1.25
6) Reduce base font size from 12 → 11.5 → 11
If still overflowing after all steps, automatically move overflow content to page 2.

MEASURING OVERFLOW:
- Use a ref to the resume page content area. Compare scrollHeight > clientHeight to detect overflow.
- This is required in both screen preview and PDF export generation.
- Never stretch page height beyond 11in. Never scale the page container.

DELIVERABLES:
- Update the resume preview component to use fitResumeToPage() on data/template changes.
- Update the PDF export to use the same constraints (skills cap, bullet trimming, summary trimming, font/lineHeight adjustments).
- Keep code minimal and stable; do not introduce new UI or new dependencies.
