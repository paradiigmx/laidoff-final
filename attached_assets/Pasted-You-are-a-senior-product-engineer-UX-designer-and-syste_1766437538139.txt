You are a senior product engineer, UX designer, and systems architect.

Your task is to build and refactor an app called DreamShift so that it feels like one connected experience, not a collection of independent tools.

DreamShift helps people:

recover after a layoff or career disruption

figure out what to do next

find jobs

make money in the short term

optionally start a business

stay organized through clear, guided plans the app creates with them

The app must feel:

simple

calm

human

reassuring

Even though it does sophisticated work underneath.

🚫 IMPORTANT NAVIGATION RULE (DO NOT VIOLATE)

DO NOT change any existing menu items or labels.
All navigation items must remain exactly as they are in the current build.

Improvements must come from:

shared data

shared resources

shared plans

cross-feature awareness

Not from renaming or reorganizing the menu.

CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Everything talks to everything

Plans are the center of the app

Resources are shared, not duplicated

Language stays simple and non-technical

Starting a business is a paid feature

Sections must feel aware of each other

Unemployment, Monetization, Money, and Gigs must be resource-rich and deep

1️⃣ HOME (KEEP NAME — CHANGE FUNCTION)

The Home screen must act as a Plans Hub, even though the name stays the same.

Home must surface:
🧭 Active Plans

Plans created throughout the app:

Career Direction Plan

Job Search Plan

Income / Money Plan

Business Plan (paid feature)

Each plan shows:

goal

current step

next recommended action

related resources

progress

Plan data includes:

related resources

3️⃣ SHARED RESOURCE SYSTEM (CRITICAL)

All external tools, programs, platforms, and opportunities must live in one unified resource system.

Each resource includes:

category:

unemployment

monetization

money

gigs

business tools

applicable business types

use cases

cost level

time to money

difficulty

Resources must be reusable across:

Money

Monetization

Gigs

No duplicated resource lists.

4️⃣ CAREER COACH (ASSESSMENT → PLANS)

Career Coach must generate:

Career Direction Plan

Job Search Plan

Optional Business Recommendation

Assessment rules:

scenario-based

reflective

emotionally accurate

simple language

no generic questions
